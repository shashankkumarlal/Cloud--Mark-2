## Website Uptime Monitoring with AWS Lambda and S3

Overview

This project automates website uptime monitoring using AWS Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch. It checks the website status every 5 minutes and logs the results in an S3 bucket. CloudWatch alarms can notify you via email when the website is down.

Features

Automated uptime checks every 5 minutes

Logs website status in an S3 bucket

Sends alerts via AWS CloudWatch and SNS when the website is down

Uses AWS Lambda for serverless execution

Architecture

Lambda Function - Periodically checks the website status.

S3 Bucket - Stores the logs of website uptime.

CloudWatch - Triggers the Lambda function and monitors logs.

SNS Notification - Sends alerts when the website is down.

Project Setup

1. Create an S3 Bucket

Go to AWS S3 Console.

Click Create bucket.

Name the bucket (e.g., website-uptime-logs-04112004).

Enable public access blocking (recommended).

Click Create bucket.

Select website-uptime-checker.

Set Threshold: >= 1 error in 5 minutes.

Attach SNS topic WebsiteUptimeAlerts.

Click Create Alarm.

CloudWatch logs and alarms will show website uptime and downtime. Hereâ€™s what that means:

âœ… Uptime (Website is Up)
When your website is working fine, CloudWatch will record successful HTTP requests (status 200 OK).
The alarm will stay in the OK state.
No action neededâ€”you wonâ€™t get any alerts.
ðŸš¨ Downtime (Website is Down)
If your website stops responding or returns an error (e.g., 500, 503, timeout), CloudWatch detects it.
The alarm will switch to ALARM state.
Youâ€™ll get an email notification via SNS saying your website is down.
The logs will show failed requests and errors.
ðŸ”„ Every 5 Minutesâ€¦
Your Lambda function runs and checks the websiteâ€™s status.
CloudWatch logs each result (success or failure).
If the site is down, CloudWatch triggers the alarm, and youâ€™ll get notified.
You can watch these logs in CloudWatch Logs â†’ Log Groups and see your alarm state under CloudWatch Alarms
